Background: Zika virus infection (ZIKV) epidemic became in 2016 a public health emergency of international concern in Latin America and the Caribbean (LA&amp;C). We aimed to estimate the incidence of ZIKV among French travellers visiting LA&amp;C during the summer of 2016.
Materials/methods: Adult travellers to LA&amp;C attending a visit from June to September 2016 at a French pre- travel clinic were invited to participate excluding past history of ZIKV or journey to LA&amp;C since 2015. A screening was performed after return with both routine Euroimmun® ELISA (EI) IgM/IgG and in-house ELISA tests of the CNR with IgM antibody capture (MAC) and indirect IgG with the use of complete virus lysate (INDG) assays. A gold standard virus neutralization test (VNT) was retrospectively performed when positive or equivocal ELISA results or ZIKV-like symptoms.
Results: Of the 324 eligible travellers, 75 were included. Of them, 42 (56%) were women, with a median age of 34 years [IQR 29 – 55]. Median length of stay was 20 days [IQR 15 – 33]. Destinations were South America 63 (84%), Central America 6 (8%) and Caribbean 6 (8%). Half (38) reported at least one health event including 7 (9%) fever and 12 (16%) others ZIKV-like symptoms (7 rashes, 5 pruritus). ELISA tests with EI IgM and MAC were all negative while EI IgG and INDG were positive for 4 and 1 travellers respectively. Four (5%) ZIKV cases were retrospectively confirmed by a subsequent positive VNT: one woman who presented fever in Guadeloupe [EI IgG positive; MAC negative and INDG positive] and three women with dermatological ZKV-like symptoms among whom 1 in Martinique [EI IgG negative and INDG negative] and 2 in Nicaragua with [EI IgG positive and INDG negative] and [initial EI IgG negative; late EI IgG equivocal and INDG negative]. The incidence rate was 5.9 ZIKV cases per 100 persons-months [IC95 1.9 – 14.3].
Conclusions: This study is the first to report a suitable ZIKV incidence rate among travellers. The ZIKV cases with non-febrile symptoms would not have been confirmed without the pugnacity of physicians for obtaining a VNT. This emphasize the need for reliable routine ZIKV tests.</p>

Background: According to the WHO position paper published in September 2018, the preferred strategy for use of the tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) in endemic settings is to screen for prior dengue infection (PDI) before vaccination. Detection of anti-dengue IgG using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is generally used to determine PDI status, however ELISAs are less specific than neutralization assays because of flavivirus cross-reactivity. We determined the suitability of four rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and two conventional ELISAs to identify PDI and assessed flavivirus cross-reactivity. <br> Materials/methods: The evaluation panel comprised baseline serum samples collected in CYD-TDV clinical trials and from Sanofi employees. Specificity was assessed using 534 dengue PRNT50 negative samples from continental USA and endemic regions. Negativity of endemic region samples was further confirmed by dengue NS1 IgG ELISA. Sensitivity was assessed using 270 samples from recent (within 13 months, n=90) or remote (3 to 4 years, n=90) prior virologically-confirmed dengue cases, and dengue PRNT50 positive samples from endemic regions (n=90). Cross-reactivity was assessed in 194 dengue seronegative samples that were seropositive for one of the following viruses: yellow fever (n=57), Japanese encephalitis (n=37), West-Nile (n=59) or Zika (n=41). RDTs were from Alere/SD Bioline, Bio-Rad, CTK and GenBody. Indirect dengue IgG ELISAs were from Alere/Panbio and Focus Diagnostics. <br> Results: All evaluated RDTs and the Panbio Indirect IgG ELISA had favorable specificity (&gt;98%). RDT sensitivity for identifying PDI was moderate (40%–70%) and lower than with the ELISAs (≥90%). Cross-reactivity to Japanese encephalitis was not observed with any RDT. Cross-reactivity to other flaviviruses was uncommon. Only the CTK RDT showed no cross-reactivity, and ELISAs were more cross-reactive than RDTs. None of the RDTs or ELISAs displayed substantial differences for detection of recent versus remote PDI. <br> Conclusions: All RDTs showed high specificity and low cross-reactivity, which minimizes the risk of vaccinating individuals not previously infected with dengue. RDTs varied in sensitivity and could be improved in this regard, which would minimize the number of individuals omitted from vaccination. Despite limitations, currently available dengue RDTs could be temporizing tools in endemic settings where dengue vaccination is being considered, assuming local assessment of performance.</p>

              <h2>Potential risk factors associated with human cystic echinoccoccosis infection investigated trough a semi-structured questionnaire during a large ultrasound prevalence survey in Eastern Europe</h2>
              <p class="item-intro text-muted">Francesca Tamarozzi Okan Akhan Carmen-Michaela Cretu Kamenna Vutova Massimo Fabiani Serra Orsten Patrizio Pezzotti Gabriela Loredana Popa Valeri Velev Mar Siles-Lucas Enrico Brunetti Adriano Casulli</p>
              
              <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="https://example.org/img/portfolio/poster-03.png" alt="">
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Background: Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a neglected parasitic zoonosis prioritized by the WHO for control. Hygiene education is included in CE control campaigns; ingestion of contaminated food/water and contact with dogs are classically mentioned as infection sources, however, the precise risk factors for human infection are poorly understood. Several works investigated the potential risk factors through questionnaires, mostly carried out on small samples, providing contrasting results. We present the analysis of risk factors questionnaires administered to participants to the largest research-based prevalence study on CE conducted in Eastern Europe.
Materials/methods: A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to 24,687 people from rural Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey, who underwent abdominal ultrasound. Questions concerned demography, CE awareness, occurrence of cases in the family, dog and livestock-related practices, and food- and drinking water-related habits. “CE cases” were individuals with abdominal CE detected on ultrasound. Variables associated with CE infection at p&lt;0.20 in bivariate analysis were included into a multivariable logistic model, with a random effect to account for clustering at village level. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95%CI were used to describe the strength of associations. Data were weighted to reflect the relative distribution of the rural population in the study area by country, age group and sex.
Results: Valid records from 22,027 people were analyzed. According to the main occupation in the past 20 years, “housewife” (AOR 3.11 [1.51-6.41]) and “retired” (AOR 2.88 [1.09-7.65]) showed a significantly higher risk of being infected compared to non-agricultural workers. “Having relatives with CE” (AOR 4.18 [1.77-9.88]) was associated with higher odds of CE infection. Strikingly, dog-related and food/water-related factors were not associated with human infection.
Conclusions: Our results point to infection being acquired in a “domestic” rural environment and support the view that CE should be considered more a “soil-transmitted” than a “food-borne” infection, acquired through a “hand-to-mouth” mechanism. This result helps delineating the dynamics of infection transmission and have practical implications in the design of community/habits-specific questionnaires and studies on parasite contamination of matrices, to shed light on actual sources of infection and at-risk behaviors and inform control campaigns.
